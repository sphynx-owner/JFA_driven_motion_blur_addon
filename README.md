# Instructions

1. Take the contents of the "addons" folder and move them to an "addons" folder in your project.
2. Add an environment node, then add a MotionBlurCompositor (NEW!!) to it.
3. Add a new PreBlurProcessor effect, which is now required. After it, add a new GuertinMotionBlur, SphynxSimpleJumpFloodMotionBlur, or ExperimentalJumpFloodMotionBlur.
4. For debugging, add "C", "Z", and "freeze" input events. Then add a DebugCompositorEffect to the compositor effects. Toggle "Debug" to true on whichever effect you want to show debug information for.

* **GuertinMotionBlur** - An all-around best blur effect, robust, performant, and now also realistic.
* **SphynxSimpleJumpFloodMotionBlur** - An effect driven by a novel dilation method using the jump flood algorithm. It is used in research of realistic blending schemes and focuses on being a retrospective blur approach.
* **ExperimentalJumpFloodMotionBlur** - An effect driven by a novel dilation method using the jump flood algorithm. It uses an added feature to heuristically fake transparency of the leading edge of the blur using the past color output.

**WARNING:**
If you want transparent objects to render on top of the blurred background, you can move the pre-blur-processing and blur post-process effects both to the callback type of pre-transparent. At this point, it would not work if you have MSAA enabled, so make sure to also turn that off.
